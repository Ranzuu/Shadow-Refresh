# GTNH Shadow Refresh
  Custom resource pack for GregTech New Horizon, minecraft version: 1.7.10.

  This recource pack was created because I (Ranzu) wanted to have everything that I like in one pack and to edit it as I want. This is edited combination of darker gui pack and packs that refresh your game with new blocks/items/etc textures. Most of the texture are ported from other resource packs listed below. Some new and some are edited, especially the AE2 Dark Mode as it needed backporting. 
  
Contribution goes as follow, let's all thanks these guys for brining the future into the past:
